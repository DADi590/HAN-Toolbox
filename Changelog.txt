---UNOFFICIAL--
* [LATEST] v0.9 (2020/04/05) : - VÃŠ A DATA DISTO!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
- Added support for HFW/CFW 4.86 CEX;
- Fixed Database Rebuilder not working (too many characters, so the PS3 will not load it) - sorry, I didn't know this at the time;
- Offline Temperature Reader now displays the temperatures also in Fahrenheit;
- The rest of the offline CEX functions are now in DEX too (more specifically: Database Rebuilder, File Copier, Flash Mounter and Temperature Reader);
- Added an update checker for HAN Toolbox Unofficial updates in HAN Enabler and Debug Packages Enabler.

- Added an Update page and a Changelog page. Both pages are 100% offline. The first one points to where to download updates if there are any (the page checks for updates by itself and shows if there are any updates available). The second only describes all changelogs since the first version of the official HAN Toolbox to the newest version of the unofficial version (this version).

* v0.8.1 (2019/09/13) :
- Fixed DEX options (HAN Toolbox wouldn't load on DEX), since I added the new options, but I forgot to tell the PS3 to load them (added Attributes but I forgot to edit the Queries)... Sorry, my bad. Realized it when I was copying the code to add to another toolbox.

* v0.8 (2019/09/12) :
- Added support for offline HAN main functions on OFW/HFW 4.81-4.85, CEX and DEX;
- Added Offline Hard Rebooter;
- Added the word "Offline" to all offline functions.
