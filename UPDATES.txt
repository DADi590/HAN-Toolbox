File for HAN Toolbox Unofficial to check and prompt about updates linked bellow (the same that are on "Releases")
---

> Don't forget... --> After 0.90 comes 1.00, NOT 0.10 (on the first one, after 0.9 comes 0.10, the second one is 1.00 - Christ, idiot less than 1 versions hahaha. NOTE: when the first gets to 1.0, the second gets to 10.0 (multiply by ten, it's the same, the second is just to check bigger or less or equal version)). Unless you actually can make it version 1.0...

> The first number is a string to show the version to the user. The second one is the number for the toolbox to check if it's a newer version or not.

4.85 AND 4.86 FIX FOR FREEZING --> 1.0 --> https://www.psx-place.com/threads/han-enabler-4-86-issues.28841/page-4#post-235423

- Offline HAN Enabler seems not to be working for at least HFW/CFW 4.86. Please use the online enabler on HAN Functions --> Online HAN Functions until I release a new version with it fixed. I'm sorry, that might take a bit, because I really busy studying and it takes much time to check everything again (and actually do it from zero). But use the online enabler which works just fine.

- I'm sorry about this, it shouldn't happen. Hopefully was the last time, as I was told I was doing the version check (to support all versions) in a way that was not necessary and just complicates things. So from now on I'll do it as I wanted in the beggining but I was not sure about it, so I made the hard way.

- Hope people see this hahaha.
