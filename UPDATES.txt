File for HAN Toolbox to check and prompt for updates linked below (the same that are on "Releases")
---

> Don't forget... --> After 0.90 comes 1.00, NOT 0.10 (on the first one, after 0.9 comes 0.10, the second one is 1.00 - Christ, idiot less than 1 versions hahaha. NOTE: when the first gets to 1.0, the second gets to 10.0 (multiply by ten, it's the same, the second is just to check bigger or less or equal version)). Unless you actually can make it version 1.0...

> The first number is a string to show the version to the user. The second one is the number for the toolbox to check if it's a newer version or not.

0.14 --> 0.914 --> https://github.com/Edw590/HAN-Toolbox-Unofficial/releases/download/v0.14/HAN_Toolbox_0_14_Unofficial_EN.pkg_signed.pkg

- Added support for HFW/CFW 4.80 CEX and older, as long as needed values don't change on older versions.
- Corrected 3 pictures not working after v0.13.
- Changed all ps3xploit.com references to ps3xploit.me (the current official domain).
- Hopefully corrected all tools that weren't working on any FW version, if any wasn't (new "technique" applied everywhere, both on CEX and DEX tools. That includes adding to DEX the past and future-proof support that I added to the CEX tools).
