File for HAN Toolbox Unofficial to check and prompt about updates linked bellow (the same that are on "Releases")
---
0.9 --> 0.90 --> http://github.com/DADi590/HAN-Toolbox-Unofficial/releases/download/v0.8/HAN_Toolbox_Unofficial_0_9_EN.pkg
- Added support for FW 4.86 CEX;

- Fixed Database Rebuilder not working (too many characters, so the PS3 will not load it) - sorry, I didn't know this at the time;

- Offline Temperature Reader now displays the temperatures also in Fahrenheit;

- The rest of the offline CEX functions are now in DEX too (more specifically: Database Rebuilder, File Copier, Flash Mounter and Temperature Reader).
